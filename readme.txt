This text file just has information about each of the .R files.

---------------------------------------------------------------

bike.RData = This is the bike data for the bike example.

Bike_Data_FNN.Final.R = This file reproduces the results for the bike example (table 1).

FNC_FNN_Final.R = This files gives the functional weights (in the code, these are referred to as FNC due to a previous naming convention) for the bike and weather examples (figure 3 and 4).

FNC_Iteration_Final.R = This file reproduces figure 2 of paper.

FNN.R = Main file with all functions used in the paper.

FNN_SimCodeMay2020.R = Results from simulation section of paper when we recover beta(s) (figure 5 and table 4).

FNN - Simulation Predictions - Final.R = This reproduces the the functional predictions for the simulations (figure 6).

Non-Functional - Simulation Predictions.R = This reproduces the multivariate simulation prediction results (figure 6).

Tecator_Data_FNN_Final.R = This file reproduces the Tecator data example results (table 2).

Weather_Data_FNN_Final.R = This file reproduces the results for the weather example (table 3).

Weather_Tuning_FNN = An example file of how tuning could be done using the provided functions.
